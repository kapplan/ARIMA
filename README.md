# Time Series Forecasting and Analysis using ARIMA (Predicting Poland's Inflation)

Forecasting is a challenging job, requiring a delicate balance of intuition, analysis, and a sprinkle of luck. A good forecast is almost like magic, and a faulty one can have really bad consequences. Whether it's predicting consumer behavior, estimating sales figures, or foreseeing industry changes, accurate forecasting helps us navigate the uncertain terrain of the future. We can anticipate market trends, plan for future demands, and make informed decisions that can shape our success.\

Time series data consists of a sequence of data points collected at regular time intervals. This type of data is essential in various industries, including finance, economics, and weather forecasting. Analyzing time series data allows us to uncover valuable patterns, trends, and correlations that enable informed decision-making and predictions.

This project has two main goals: time series analysis from a theoretical perspective, and deploying a machine learning model that forecasts inflation along the way.
I will explain the theory behind the practice of forecasting inflation. My focus will be on the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), which is an indicator of inflation and price stability for the European Central Bank (ECB).

## Objective
- Understand the characteristics of the inflation rate data. Identify trends, seasonality, and any patterns that might influence the inflation rate.
- Build a model that can predict the future values of inflation rate in Poland for the latter half of 2023 using HICP data.
- Based on the forecasted inflation rates, provide recommendations to stakeholders, policymakers, and businesses on potential strategies to adapt to the predicted economic environment.
## Problem definition
Rising inflation reduces consumers' purchasing power. It can erode consumer confidence in spending, leading to an economic slowdown. High inflation can lead to uncertainty about future costs and revenues, impacting investment decisions. Inflation often leads to higher costs for raw materials, labor, and energy, reducing profit margins. Additionally, High inflation can lead to currency depreciation, affecting international trade and investments.
By addressing these potential risks and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, businesses and governments can better navigate the challenges associated with increasing inflation, foster resilience, and minimize negative impacts.
